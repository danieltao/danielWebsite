        <h3 class="mb-4"> ------What I have learned from the class------ </h3>
        <h4>   As the world marches onward to the era of information, the role social media plays in the society has been increasingly significant. Some people use it to announce breaking news, some people use it to brand themselves and gain profit out of the mass amount of attention that was never possible before the age of social media, and some people use it to govern a country. However, although there are many different purposes of blogging and social media posts, the majority of the people who use social media do not take it too seriously. For them, social media such as Instagram and twitter are nothing but a place to share their thoughts, their life, and their voices with the world. It is their personal space to put in their thoughts, photos, and experiences. However, in most cases, they forget that because of the very nature of social media, their posts are read and judged by others. People might be influenced by their posts, even though they are personal. I used to be one of the crowd that posts carelessly and just treat my social media posts as my personal belongings, and the most important lesson I have learned from the class is that social media is shared socially, and we should be responsible for every single word we posted. </h4>
        <h4>  My attitude towards writing on social media has been significantly changed. I used to see my writing as completely personal and I used to write whatever I want in my posts. However, thanks to the class, I start to think twice before I post, and will always make sure that no one is offended. For instance, in my post 3 I commented that my company’s dress code is “the most formal I have heard of”. Instead of saying bluntly that “the dress code is ridiculous for a tech company”, I carefully chose the words so that the company would not be offended and no one would feel attacked from reading my posts. I have also been more conscious about the issue in reading others’ posts. I would remind them of any word choices that might make some of the readers uncomfortable, and would also point them out in the comment session in the forum. My understanding of the theory has also been improved by the experience of composing a blog myself. Since I chose the tone in my blog to be casual and informative, and because I covered a lot about technology and information in my blogs, which could potentially make my blogs dry and hard to follow, I have to make some jokes in my blog posts. It is really hard to think of some jokes that are appropriate for everyone, and still be funny, to be honest. The most common thing that happens when I am writing is that I would write out a piece of joke, look at it, realize that it is kind of aggressive for some readers, delete it, and stare at my screen, trying to come up with a new one. It makes me realize how easy it could be to cross the border, and we should all be careful when trying to send a message that the entire world could hear.</h4>

        <h3 class="mb-4"> ------What does it mean to be a software engineer------ </h3>
        <h4>A software engineer’s typical work day involves juggling a variety of tasks and balancing working on numerous software projects that are often in different stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Meetings to discuss software project status updates, new software project roadmaps, and organizational logistics such as new hires also play a key role in a software engineer’s workweek. </h4>
        <h4>Software engineers are expected to prioritize their tasks while working on several software projects in parallel, and as a result their work day might involve writing or refining software code for one project in the morning before attending or running a meeting to cover the progress on another software project, followed by conceptualizing and developing ideas and requirements for an upcoming project, before finally wrapping up the day by documenting milestones and progress made over the course of the day or week. </h4>
        <h4>Because a software engineer is expected to be able to balance numerous tasks as well as be able to tackle problems at both a deep, code-based level as well as a broad, “big picture” level, a computer software engineer’s work regularly involves:</h4>
        <h3 class="mb-4"> ------What is a typical day of a software engineer------</h3>
        <h4>What does it mean to sit in front of a desk, from 9 to 6 every day, staring at a computer? It means 3 cups of coffee, 2 cups of tea, a quick lunch, and hundreds of lines of codes to understand while only produce a couple of lines of codes. That does not sound enjoyable, does it?</h4>
        <h4>I don’t know how many of you have played the game Minecraft before. It is a game about placing blocks and going on adventures. For beginners, the game is really simple. All you need to do is to delete blocks, gather them, and put them together to form new resource. No one cares how ugly your house looks, and it does not really matter. It is only you who is playing, anyways. However, as you level up in the game and connect with others, style matters. There are numerous of amazing videos on how nice people’s creation looks, and someone even built a functioning computer inside the game, using the basic logic block provided by the game, which could only represent zero and one. Same rules apply in coding. Once you reached a certain level, how many lines you write does not matter that much. You have to care more about styling, especially if you are working on a large codebase that has the potential to influence millions of people. Every line you commit has the potential to mess up everything.</h4>
        <h4>I was not totally aware of the importance of styling until my codes got rejected and criticized harshly. Used to work on personal or small group projects only, I was not concerned with styling at all when I code. It is the quantity that matters, and I would happily write an if-else statement, just to get the max or min value of a pair of numbers. Print statements were also fine as long as they were commented out. I would style the file based on my personal preference, adding new lines or deleting spaces as long as I like it. Those are horrible habits. Some argue that compared to writing or researching, coding has the power of reaching more people and influencing more lives. However, with the great potential comes the great responsibility. When working on projects that are too important to fail one has to follow all the rules, no matter how trivial they might look. I learned the significance of styling in just 1 rejection of submission from my boss, in thirty minutes.</h4>
        <h4>So, what does it mean to sit in front of a desk from 9 to 6 every day, staring at my computer? It means lots of learning, joy, and growing. I am becoming a better coder every day.</h4>
        <h3 class="mb-4"> ------What are some fun places in Boston?------ </h3>
        <h4>Where should I start? While some people think Harvard and MIT are the places they should check out, I would not agree on that. What is the point of going to visit a school? Especially when they are not real “campus”, but several blocks in the city. There are some interesting sculptures for sure, but it would not be worth it to share pictures of them, let alone touching and posing around them. What is the point of seeing the Duke in the north, when you could see Duke directly? However, although the campus of MIT and Harvard are not my interests, the food near Harvard is amazing. When you come to Boston in the future if you are lucky enough, the go to place for food would be Harvard Square. There are just so many options, and you could find anything you want, let it be American, Korean, Chinese, Sushi, Udon, Ramen, Ice Cream, books (soul food), coffee… If there is anything that I would jealous Harvard students of, it would be the food options they have.</h4>
<h4>In every big city of the United States, Chinatown is always the best food place if you are interested in Asian food. The Chinatown in Boston is no disappointment. The first week I got to Boston, I went to Chinatown 2 times in a day, waited in the cold weather (yes, it was very chilly in May) for 30 minutes, just because the food was so good. There was a really small restaurant that only takes cash called Susu, and there is always a line in front of the door, no matter when. The clay pot rice they have is so authentic and good, and my mouth waters as I am writing the paragraph. The lobsters in Chinatown are also quite unique. Thanks to the amazing location of Boston and the wide collection of seafood options, you could taste some Chinese style lobsters with a really low price. There is also a really good roast duck place called “the fatty guy”. The name pretty much explains how good it is. </h4>
<h4>After food, it is not a bad idea to work out a bit. While a walk around Boston Garden is recommended, I would love to introduce the idea of kayaking over Charles river. I could not verbally describe how amazing it is to have the breeze on the river blowing through your hair, and it is something that one has to experience himself.</h4>
